## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### 🏢 Production Deployment
- **Use HTTPS** - Always deploy with SSL/TLS certificates
- **Secure Headers** - Implement security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- **Regular Updates** - Keep ByteLedger and dependencies updated
- **Environment Variables** - Never commit sensitive data to version control
- **File Permissions** - Properly configure file and directory permissions
- **Backup Security** - Encrypt and secure your data backups

#### 👤 User Management
- **Strong Sessions** - Use secure session management
- **Employee Access** - Regularly review employee access
- **Data Validation** - Validate all user inputs
- **Audit Logs** - Monitor and log important actions

#### 🗄️ Data Protection
- **Sensitive Data** - Encrypt sensitive information at rest
- **Data Retention** - Implement proper data retention policies
- **Access Control** - Limit access to sensitive operations
- **Regular Backups** - Maintain secure, tested backups

### For Developers

#### 🔧 Development Practices
- **Secure Coding** - Follow OWASP secure coding practices
- **Input Validation** - Validate and sanitize all inputs
- **Error Handling** - Avoid exposing sensitive information in errors
- **Dependency Management** - Regularly audit and update dependencies
- **Code Reviews** - Implement security-focused code reviews

#### 🧪 Testing
- **Security Testing** - Include security tests in your test suite
- **Penetration Testing** - Regular security assessments
- **Static Analysis** - Use static code analysis tools
- **Dependency Scanning** - Scan for vulnerable dependencies

## ⚠️ Known Security Considerations

### Current Architecture

ByteLedger uses a file-based storage system with the following considerations:

#### 🗃️ File-Based Storage
- **Data Location**: Sensitive data stored in JSON files
- **Access Control**: Relies on file system permissions
- **Recommendation**: Consider database migration for production use

#### 🔑 Session Management
- **Cookie-Based**: Uses HTTP cookies for session storage
- **No External Auth**: No OAuth or external authentication providers
- **Recommendation**: Implement proper session expiration and CSRF protection

#### 📁 File Uploads
- **Avatar Storage**: Direct file system storage for employee avatars
- **Validation**: Basic file type validation
- **Recommendation**: Implement comprehensive file validation and scanning

### Security Enhancements Roadmap

- [ ] **Database Migration** - Move from file-based to database storage
- [ ] **Enhanced Authentication** - Add 2FA and OAuth support
- [ ] **API Rate Limiting** - Implement request rate limiting
- [ ] **Audit Logging** - Comprehensive action logging
- [ ] **Data Encryption** - Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- [ ] **CSRF Protection** - Add CSRF tokens to forms
- [ ] **Content Security Policy** - Implement strict CSP headers
